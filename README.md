# ClusteringAnalysis #

Particles tend to cluster due to various effects such as turbulence in particle-laden flows and identifying them is quite open-ended. However, several ideas from the data-clustering community can be readily applied to this problem. 

## Summary of set up ##

The different methods are defined in `clustering.py`. A test of various methods can be performed using `test_clustering.py`.
